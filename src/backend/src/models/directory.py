"""Pydantic API models for the Directory layer (external IdP lookups).

The Directory layer is the generic abstraction over identity providers.
v1 ships three concrete providers:

- ``entra``    — Microsoft Entra ID via Microsoft Graph (UC HTTP Connection)
- ``lakebase`` — a Postgres table sitting in the app's Lakebase instance
- ``file``     — a local CSV file (primarily for tests and demos)

The manager / routes / models stay provider-agnostic so future
providers (Okta, Ping, ...) can be added without breaking changes.

See plans/directory-lookup-and-principal-picker.md.
