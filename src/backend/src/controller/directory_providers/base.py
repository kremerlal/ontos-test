"""Abstract DirectoryProvider interface implemented by every concrete provider.

Providers receive a small ``DirectoryProviderContext`` so they can pull
in whatever transport they need (Databricks SDK workspace client for
Entra; SQLAlchemy engine for Lakebase; filesystem for File). They also
receive a typed ``DirectoryProviderConfig`` carrying every directory
setting -- each provider reads only the fields relevant to its type
and raises ``DirectoryError`` on missing required values.
